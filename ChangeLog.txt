4.5.1:
* Added a cancel command for the rollback, that should cancel the rollback currently active.
* Added a check if the player is already rolling something back, if so don't let him do a second rollback.
* Made it so that the friends are checked entirely by the isOnFriendsList function in ConfigHandler.
* Added player quit logging.
* Added command to teleport to the last known location of any player that is offline.
* Changed some booleans to private instead of public and made getters for them, setter are not yet needed.
* Made the world edit filter work on a thread instead of having it do that on the main thread.
* Fixed a bug that threw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because the blacklist didn't contain anything.
* Added a possibility to check if the ArgumentParser generated an exception.
* Changed the way the worldedit filter works on the search results(using threads now).
* Fixed the tool, didn't work because of the worldedit filter or so, dunno why exactly, but it works now again:)

4.6
* Fixed the worldedit filter.
* Added actions to fix the problem that the result was null because the search wasn't ready yet.
* Fixed the rollback not rolling back lava and water because i changed the log string there a while ago
* Made the lava and water rollback the 8 blocks around the source block
* Fixed the worldedit filter not filtering the newest version of the log
* Fixed the worldedit filter not filtering the newest explosions
* Added a check to see if CreeperHeal is enabled, if so don't log explosions, it will result in loggin AIR
* Split the rollback function in smaller pieces (this is part of my optimization quest:P) 
* Added a guess of how long a rollback will take in seconds
* Fixed a bug in the onEnable method making a call to a not existing configuration instance
* Fixed a little bug in the BlockProtectionAction, i was calling the wrong event which resulted in a npe
* Renamed the actions to callback, because that's what it really is
* Split some functions for better readability
* Fixed that the config was not loaded when first time running

4.6.7
* Fixed a bug with the blockprotection when it was enabled it would send the searching... message by every block break event
* Added block type and data to BlockIgnite logging
* Added block data logging, will appear like this: DIRT:0 or LEVER:3
* Added rollback for block data, this will make all your stairs look good after rollback xD
* Fixed a bug with the ConsoleCommandSender and GLPlayer == NPE
* Fixed a bug, if the rollback was complete, the taskId wasn't cleared 
  so when someone used /glog cancel another task was cancelled and not the rollback


4.6.8
* Fixed a bug in the /glog tool command

4.7
* Dropped rollback support for the older versions 2.* and 3.*, some might work, i don't know
* Added "DataEntries" that are the classes in tk.blackwolf12333.grieflog.data
* Added loadFromString to BaseData classes to create a new instance of a DataEntry from a string from the logs
* Added rollback function in the DataEntries for easier rollback
* Improved the rollback
* Added zombie and enderman grief rollback
* And as always, fixed lots of bugs:)
* Fixed a very dumb bug, arrays don't go from 1 to 3 but from 0 to 2...
* Added configuration change check to load the new configuration options while keeping the old ones intact
